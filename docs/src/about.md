![IntegerSequences](SequencesLogo.jpg)

**A Julia module implementing mathematical integer sequences**

Build a Julia library for studying mathematical integer sequences. To this goal the library should:

* Identify general methods used in generating integer sequences and provide reference implementations for important classes.

* Provide a set of classical sequence-to-sequence, sequence-to-triangle and triangle-to-sequence transformations.

* Provide a low level infrastructure for efficient development and testing of integer series and sequences.
